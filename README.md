# This code is used to create a Python pip module. The module is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/hegwout/pynb. It also sets up automatic CI/CD, allowing for automatic submission to the pip repository.
# 创建一个python的pip模块, 在github上的托管地址是 https://github.com/hegwout/pynb, 创建自动CI/CD, 可以自动提交到pip仓库

# To create a Python pip module, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub at https://github.com/hegwout/pynb.

2. Set up your project structure by creating the necessary files and directories. Make sure to include a `setup.py` file that defines your module's metadata.


3. Write your Python code and place it in the appropriate directory within your project structure.

    Your project structure should look something like this:

    ```
    pynb/
    ├── setup.py
    ├── nb/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── nb.py
    └── README.md
    ```

    In this structure, `pynb` is the root directory of your project. The `setup.py` file should be placed in the root directory and define the metadata for your module. The `your_module` directory is where you should place your Python code. You can create additional directories within `your_module` if needed.

    Make sure to update the file and directory names to match your specific project and module names.

    Once you have placed your Python code in the appropriate directory, you can continue with the remaining steps.

4. Create a virtual environment and activate it.

5. Install the necessary dependencies using pip.

6. Test your module to ensure it works as expected.


7. Commit and push your code to the GitHub repository.

8. Set up automatic CI/CD by using a continuous integration service like Travis CI or GitHub Actions. These services can be configured to run tests, build your module, and automatically deploy it to the pip repository.

9. Configure your CI/CD service to automatically trigger a build and deployment whenever changes are pushed to the GitHub repository.

10. Publish your module to the pip repository by following the documentation provided by the repository.

Remember to update the README.md file in your repository with relevant information about your module, including installation instructions and usage examples.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
